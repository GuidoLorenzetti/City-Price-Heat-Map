# City-Price-Heat-Map
Cost distribution of any city from the data provided by http://insideairbnb.com
To use the program, go to http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/, and choose a city. Download the "listings.csv" file, and load it in the same folder as the console. Execute the program and you should see the heatmap for the city that you choose.

Posibles fix if the map is not properly displayed:
1- Try changing the "vmax" value in the 68 line.
2- Make sure that the "listings.csv" file doesnÂ´t have any extra character in it.
